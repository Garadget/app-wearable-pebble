# app-wearable-pebble
Garadget app for Pebble watch

This is the first released beta version, available (but not searchable) on the app store as https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/5717624b39001518cf000012.

Deliberately compiled with SDK2 so as to support legacy Aplite, the intention is to get the basic functionality right so that there's a working version for watches that haven't been upgraded, then move to SDK 3 and start adding color and other cosmetic improvements.
